Zion National Park, located in the heart of the spectacular desert and
canyon country of southern Utah, has as one of its chief features the
great multicolored gorge, Zion Canyon. The sandstone cliffs, rising
sheer to form the canyon walls and encircle the valley, are awesome; but
it is the vivid coloring which most amazes. The deep red of the
Vermilion Cliffs is the prevailing tint. Two-thirds of the way up these
marvelous walls and temples are painted varying shades of red; then,
above the reds they rise in startling white, sometimes surmounted by a
cap of brilliant red.




                      Formation of Zion Canyon[1]


Zion Canyon, the best known example of a deep, narrow, vertically walled
chasm readily accessible for observation, was made by the north fork of
the Virgin River, the stream which now flows through it. Before this
stream established its course there was no canyon. During the long
period since its course was established the river has slowly deepened
its channel and extended it headward until its original shallow valley
has become a long narrow trench between towering walls. Though now
deeply entrenched in the rocks of the Kolob Plateau, the river maintains
substantially its original pattern. It flows in the same direction, and
the curves and straight stretches of its present walls duplicate the
meanders of the stream when it flowed some 5,000 feet above its present
level.

For many thousands of years the Virgin River and its tributaries have
been busy with two tasks, namely, deepening their channels and
transporting material weathered from the canyon walls. At present the
Virgin carries away from the park each year about 3,000,000 tons of
ground-up rock at an average rate of 180 carloads a day. For such
effective work the many-branched river seems incompetent. But though
relatively small in volume, this stream system falls from 50 to 70 feet
per mile (nine times the fall of the Colorado in Grand Canyon) and is at
work on rock, chiefly sandstone, that disintegrates with exceptional
ease. Many tributaries are on bare rock, little retarded by vegetation,
and are fed by short but violent showers. Consequently, they are brought
to flood stage not only seasonally but with each period of heavy
rainfall. Because they flow only in response to showers, the smaller
tributaries are unable to cut channels as deep as the perennial master
stream. From their mouths high on the canyon walls, they descend as
waterfalls.

Though they are primarily responsible for the depth and position of the
canyons, the Virgin River itself and the other streams heading on the
adjoining plateaus are only incidentally concerned with the detailed
carving that makes Zion Canyon unique. The walls are retreating in
consequence of ground water which emerges as springs and seeps, rain
which falls directly into the canyon, water that spills over the rim,
frost and tree roots which pry off slabs, and chemical agencies which
weaken the rock by the removal of the cement about individual grains.
Continuous sapping at or near the contact of the porous Navajo sandstone
and the more impervious underlying beds has developed alcoves in the
canyon walls at Wiley Retreat, the Stadium, Weeping Rock, Emerald Pool,
Birch Creek, Oak Creek, and elsewhere.

In the development of the amazing variety of architectural features on
the canyon walls, the composition and structure of the Navajo formation
have served as controlling guides. In addition to the bedding
planes—horizontal, oblique, and curved surfaces—the Navajo has developed
parting planes (joints) that extend downward for short distances or pass
through the formation from top to bottom. These bedding planes and
joints determine the shape and size of the blocks that spall off from
the towering cliff walls. Unlike that of humid regions, this type of
erosion progresses from below upward; it causes the canyon to widen and
still retain its vertical walls.

                                Wildlife


With the lower reaches of the park extending into the desert regions to
the southward, and the northernmost portions reaching into the
spruce-covered highlands, Zion offers the visitor a wide variety of
wildlife forms. Among the larger mammals, the mule deer are especially
numerous and can frequently be observed along the floor of Zion Canyon
in late evening. A few bighorn are present but spend their time in the
relatively inaccessible canyons, hence are seldom seen. Other mammals,
such as the mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, and fox, are resident within
the park, but are rarely encountered because of their timidity. Ground
squirrels and chipmunks are numerous and frequently tame. It is wisest
to enjoy them without actual contact, however, for some rodents have
been known to carry dangerous diseases.

Several species of birds are resident on the floor of the canyon, the
best known being the spurred towhee, robin, canyon wren, and yellow
warbler. Among the ponderosa pines back of the canyon rims are such
colorful songsters as the western tanager, Audubon’s warbler, and
western warbling vireo.

Of absorbing interest are the many varieties of harmless reptiles in the
canyon. Lizards, such as the blue-bellied swift and brown-shouldered
uta, are commonly observed around the brush-covered slopes, while the
Boyle’s kingsnake and wandering gartersnake are to be found in the dense
vegetation near the river.




                              Park Season


Each season of the year is distinctive in Zion. In winter, the colored
cliffs stand out in startling contrast to the snow-covered levels and
slopes; in spring, melting snows cascade over the cliff faces in foaming
white waterfalls. Summer brings with it the greens of the valley as a
foreground for the colorful formations; and in autumn when the skies are
deepest blue, the trees of the valley floor and slopes take on
variegated hues.

Although Zion Lodge is open only during the summer season, the Camp
Center, with cafeteria, store, and cabins, and the public campground at
the south entrance are operated throughout the year.




                           How to Reach Zion


Zion National Park is reached from Cedar City, Utah, on the Union
Pacific Railroad. From this point motorbus service is provided by the
Utah Parks Co. to Zion National Park, as well as to Bryce Canyon and
Grand Canyon (North Rim) National Parks and Cedar Breaks National
Monument. Passengers traveling on main bus lines may transfer to Utah
Parks Co. buses at Cedar City. On advance notice, connections can be
made with the Santa Fe Trails System at Mount Carmel Junction.

    [Illustration: _Roads connecting Bryce Canyon, Zion, Grand Canyon,
    and Cedar Breaks_]

Motorists on the Arrowhead Trail, United States Highway No. 91, from the
north may turn off at Anderson Junction, 33 miles south of Cedar City,
and those from the south may turn off at Harrisburg Bench Junction, 10
miles north of St. George, and reach Zion over State Route No. 15.
Motorists on United States Highway No. 89 should turn off on State Route
No. 15 at Mount Carmel Junction, entering Zion by the east entrance.

United Air Lines serves Salt Lake City, and from there passengers may go
by Union Pacific Railroad or bus to Cedar City. Air service is also
available from Los Angeles by Western Air Lines, with stops at Las
Vegas, Cedar City, and Salt Lake City.




                           Roads in the Park


There are 20 miles of improved roads in Zion National Park. One road
leads from the park’s entrance to the Temple of Sinawava, a distance of
8 miles. No one has really seen Zion Canyon until he has made a trip
over this road. Visitors in closed cars should make frequent stops so
that they may get out and enjoy the magnificent view.

                                          PORTION OF ZION NATIONAL PARK]

Within the park there is a section of the remarkable Zion-Mount Carmel
Highway, 11½ miles in length. Running east from the Virgin River Bridge,
this road forms a connecting link between United States Highways Nos. 91
and 89. Of special interest along this highway is the Zion Tunnel,
started in 1927 and completed in 1930. Its total length is 5,607 feet.
While the tunnel is the most spectacular portion, other sections are of
even greater scenic interest.




                            The Trail System


Approximately 26 miles of trails lead to the more important sections of
the park which are not reached by roads. These trails are well
maintained and can be used at all seasons of the year, with the
exception of those to the rims of the canyon which are closed by snow
during the winter months.

The most popular of the footpaths, which have been constructed at
different levels in the canyon, is the one extending a mile up the
canyon from the end of the road at the Temple of Sinawava to the
beginning of the Narrows. Other short and interesting trails recommended
for easy hiking include Weeping Rock, Emerald Pool, and Great Arch.

Below are listed a few trail distances. These data are for trails at
their best. Since the weather affects the condition of trails, inquiry
should be made before attempting any of them.

                             Administration


Zion National Park, containing 94,241 acres of Federal lands, is one of
the areas of the National Park System owned by the people of the United
States and administered for them by the National Park Service,
Department of the Interior. In these areas the scenery and the objects
of historic, prehistoric, and scientific interest are carefully
preserved and displayed for public enjoyment.

The representative of the National Park Service in immediate charge of
Zion National Park is the superintendent, whose post office address is
Springdale, Utah. All comments regarding service in the park should be
addressed to him.




                           Naturalist Service


During the summer season ranger naturalists conduct parties into the
field several times each day to interpret the natural features of the
area, leaving the Temple of Sinawava according to schedules posted by
the naturalist service. Each evening talks on the natural features of
the park are also given by ranger naturalists. Schedules of nature
walks, talks, and other activities are posted in public places

                                 Museum


The National Park Service has established an official information office
and museum at park headquarters which is open daily throughout the year.
Here park visitors may secure information and publications regarding
this and other national parks free of charge. The museum exhibits are
arranged to give a general idea of the outstanding features of Zion
National Park. These exhibits cover such subjects as geology, biology,
archeology, and history.

    [Illustration: _The Three Patriarchs._]

The Zion-Bryce Natural History Association maintains a stock of
publications, maps, and transparency slides which are for sale at
reasonable prices in the museum. They are designed to assist in a better
understanding and appreciation of the region.




                        Free Public Campgrounds

each party.

  “_Let no one say, and say it to your shame,
  That all was beauty here until you came._”

National Parks are established “to conserve the scenery and the natural
and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the
enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave
them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.” Please
cooperate in maintaining and protecting this park. The following
observations are made for your guidance:

Preservation of Natural Features.—Trees, flowers, vegetation, rocks,
mineral formations, or any animal, bird, or other life may not be
disturbed, injured, or destroyed; and formations, rocks, and other
natural features, may not be defaced by writing, carving, or otherwise
marring them. Since the park is a sanctuary for wildlife, hunting and
the use of firearms are prohibited.

Camping.—Camp only in established campgrounds. Keep your camp area
clean. BE CAREFUL WITH FIRE. Picnicking in the galleries of Zion Tunnel
is not permitted. Lunching and picnicking prohibited, except in public
auto camp.

Disorderly Conduct.—Proper conduct is required of all visitors for the
benefit of others who are entitled to get the fullest enjoyment from the
park.

Pets.—If you are carrying a dog, cat, or other pet, you may take it into
and through the park provided it is at all times kept on leash or
otherwise under physical restrictive control. Pets are not permitted in
public buildings or on trails.

Trails.—Do not attempt to make short cuts; to do so you may endanger
yourself as well as others using trails. Before attempting more
difficult trails seek advice from a park ranger.

Mountain Climbing.—Mountain climbing away from established trails may
not be attempted without permission of the superintendent.

Automobile Regulations.—(a) _Permit._—A charge of $1 for each automobile
is made at Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks. One permit is good for
both parks, and may be used during the remainder of the year in which
issued. Trailer fee, $1 extra.

(b) _Careful driving._—The roads in the park are built purely for scenic
purposes, not as high-speed thoroughfares. Observe speed limits and the
usual rules of the road; keep to right; do not park on curves; pass cars
going in the same direction only when the road ahead is clear and the
vision unobstructed. Maximum speed limit, 35 miles per hour.

(c) _Lights._—Because of mile-long highway tunnel, your car must have
its lights in proper condition before you will be permitted to enter
Zion National Park.

Park Rangers.—The park rangers are employed to help and advise visitors
as well as to enforce regulations. When in doubt, ask a ranger.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

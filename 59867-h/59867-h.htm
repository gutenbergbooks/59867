<p>Zion National Park,
located in the heart of
the spectacular desert
and canyon country of
southern Utah, has as
one of its chief features the great
multicolored gorge, Zion Canyon.
The sandstone cliffs, rising sheer to
form the canyon walls and encircle
the valley, are awesome; but it is the
vivid coloring which most amazes.
The deep red of the Vermilion Cliffs
is the prevailing tint. Two-thirds of
the way up these marvelous walls and
temples are painted varying shades
of red; then, above the reds they rise
in startling white, sometimes surmounted
by a cap of brilliant red.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Formation of Zion Canyon<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></span></h2>
<p>Zion Canyon, the best known example
of a deep, narrow, vertically
walled chasm readily accessible for
observation, was made by the north
fork of the Virgin River, the stream
which now flows through it. Before
this stream established its course
there was no canyon. During the
long period since its course was established
the river has slowly deepened
its channel and extended it headward
until its original shallow valley has
become a long narrow trench between
towering walls. Though now
deeply entrenched in the rocks of the
Kolob Plateau, the river maintains
substantially its original pattern. It
flows in the same direction, and the
curves and straight stretches of its
present walls duplicate the meanders
of the stream when it flowed some
5,000 feet above its present level.</p>
<p>For many thousands of years the
Virgin River and its tributaries have
been busy with two tasks, namely,
deepening their channels and transporting
material weathered from the
canyon walls. At present the Virgin
carries away from the park each year
about 3,000,000 tons of ground-up
rock at an average rate of 180 carloads
a day. For such effective work
the many-branched river seems incompetent.
But though relatively
small in volume, this stream system
falls from 50 to 70 feet per mile (nine
times the fall of the Colorado in
Grand Canyon) and is at work on
rock, chiefly sandstone, that disintegrates
with exceptional ease. Many
tributaries are on bare rock, little retarded
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
by vegetation, and are fed by
short but violent showers. Consequently,
they are brought to flood
stage not only seasonally but with
each period of heavy rainfall. Because
they flow only in response to showers,
the smaller tributaries are unable to
cut channels as deep as the perennial
master stream. From their mouths
high on the canyon walls, they descend
as waterfalls.</p>
<p>Though they are primarily responsible
for the depth and position of
the canyons, the Virgin River itself
and the other streams heading on the
adjoining plateaus are only incidentally
concerned with the detailed
carving that makes Zion Canyon
unique. The walls are retreating in
consequence of ground water which
emerges as springs and seeps, rain
which falls directly into the canyon,
water that spills over the rim, frost
and tree roots which pry off slabs,
and chemical agencies which weaken
the rock by the removal of the cement
about individual grains. Continuous
sapping at or near the contact
of the porous Navajo sandstone
and the more impervious underlying
beds has developed alcoves in the
canyon walls at Wiley Retreat, the
Stadium, Weeping Rock, Emerald
Pool, Birch Creek, Oak Creek, and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the development of the amazing
variety of architectural features on
the canyon walls, the composition
and structure of the Navajo formation
have served as controlling
guides. In addition to the bedding
planes&mdash;horizontal, oblique, and
curved surfaces&mdash;the Navajo has developed
parting planes (joints) that
extend downward for short distances
or pass through the formation from
top to bottom. These bedding planes
and joints determine the shape and
size of the blocks that spall off from
the towering cliff walls. Unlike that
of humid regions, this type of erosion
progresses from below upward; it
causes the canyon to widen and still
retain its vertical walls.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Wildlife</span></h2>
<p>With the lower reaches of the park
extending into the desert regions to
the southward, and the northernmost
portions reaching into the spruce-covered
highlands, Zion offers the
visitor a wide variety of wildlife
forms. Among the larger mammals,
the mule deer are especially numerous
and can frequently be observed
along the floor of Zion Canyon in
late evening. A few bighorn are present
but spend their time in the relatively
inaccessible canyons, hence are
seldom seen. Other mammals, such
as the mountain lion, bobcat, coyote,
and fox, are resident within the park,
but are rarely encountered because of
their timidity. Ground squirrels and
chipmunks are numerous and frequently
tame. It is wisest to enjoy
them without actual contact, however,
for some rodents have been
known to carry dangerous diseases.</p>
<p>Several species of birds are resident
on the floor of the canyon, the best
known being the spurred towhee,
robin, canyon wren, and yellow
warbler. Among the ponderosa pines
back of the canyon rims are such
colorful songsters as the western
tanager, Audubon&rsquo;s warbler, and
western warbling vireo.</p>
<p>Of absorbing interest are the many
varieties of harmless reptiles in the
canyon. Lizards, such as the blue-bellied
swift and brown-shouldered
uta, are commonly observed around
the brush-covered slopes, while the
Boyle&rsquo;s kingsnake and wandering
gartersnake are to be found in the
dense vegetation near the river.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Park Season</span></h2>
<p>Each season of the year is distinctive
in Zion. In winter, the colored
cliffs stand out in startling contrast
to the snow-covered levels and slopes;
in spring, melting snows cascade over
the cliff faces in foaming white waterfalls.
Summer brings with it the
greens of the valley as a foreground
for the colorful formations; and in
autumn when the skies are deepest
blue, the trees of the valley floor and
slopes take on variegated hues.</p>
<p>Although Zion Lodge is open only
during the summer season, the Camp
Center, with cafeteria, store, and
cabins, and the public campground
at the south entrance are operated
throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">How to Reach Zion</span></h2>
<p>Zion National Park is reached from
Cedar City, Utah, on the Union
Pacific Railroad. From this point
motorbus service is provided by the
Utah Parks Co. to Zion National
Park, as well as to Bryce Canyon and
Grand Canyon (North Rim) National
Parks and Cedar Breaks National
Monument. Passengers traveling
on main bus lines may transfer
to Utah Parks Co. buses at Cedar
City. On advance notice, connections
can be made with the Santa Fe Trails
System at Mount Carmel Junction.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Motorists on the Arrowhead Trail,
United States Highway No. 91, from
the north may turn off at Anderson
Junction, 33 miles south of Cedar
City, and those from the south may
turn off at Harrisburg Bench Junction,
10 miles north of St. George,
and reach Zion over State Route No.
15. Motorists on United States Highway
No. 89 should turn off on State
Route No. 15 at Mount Carmel Junction,
entering Zion by the east entrance.</p>
<p>United Air Lines serves Salt Lake
City, and from there passengers may
go by Union Pacific Railroad or bus
to Cedar City. Air service is also
available from Los Angeles by Western
Air Lines, with stops at Las
Vegas, Cedar City, and Salt Lake
City.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Roads in the Park</span></h2>
<p>There are 20 miles of improved
roads in Zion National Park. One
road leads from the park&rsquo;s entrance
to the Temple of Sinawava, a distance
of 8 miles. No one has really seen
Zion Canyon until he has made a trip
over this road. Visitors in closed cars
should make frequent stops so that
they may get out and enjoy the magnificent
view.</p>

PORTION OF ZION NATIONAL PARK</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Within the park there is a section
of the remarkable Zion-Mount Carmel
Highway, 11&frac12; miles in length.
Running east from the Virgin River
Bridge, this road forms a connecting
link between United States Highways
Nos. 91 and 89. Of special interest
along this highway is the Zion Tunnel,
started in 1927 and completed in
1930. Its total length is 5,607 feet.
While the tunnel is the most spectacular
portion, other sections are of
even greater scenic interest.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">The Trail System</span></h2>
<p>Approximately 26 miles of trails
lead to the more important sections
of the park which are not reached by
roads. These trails are well maintained
and can be used at all seasons
of the year, with the exception of
those to the rims of the canyon which
are closed by snow during the winter
months.</p>
<p>The most popular of the footpaths,
which have been constructed at different
levels in the canyon, is the one
extending a mile up the canyon from
the end of the road at the Temple of
Sinawava to the beginning of the
Narrows. Other short and interesting
trails recommended for easy hiking
include Weeping Rock, Emerald
Pool, and Great Arch.</p>
<p>Below are listed a few trail distances.
These data are for trails at
their best. Since the weather affects
the condition of trails, inquiry should
be made before attempting any of
them.</p>

<p>Zion National Park, containing
94,241 acres of Federal lands, is one
of the areas of the National Park System
owned by the people of the
United States and administered for
them by the National Park Service,
Department of the Interior. In these
areas the scenery and the objects of
historic, prehistoric, and scientific
interest are carefully preserved and
displayed for public enjoyment.</p>
<p>The representative of the National
Park Service in immediate charge of
Zion National Park is the superintendent,

<p class="t0"><i>That all was beauty here until you came.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>National Parks are established &ldquo;to
conserve the scenery and the natural
and historic objects and the wildlife
therein and to provide for the enjoyment
of the same in such manner and
by such means as will leave them unimpaired
for the enjoyment of future
generations.&rdquo; Please cooperate in
maintaining and protecting this park.
The following observations are made
for your guidance:</p>
<p><b>Preservation of Natural Features.</b>&mdash;Trees,
flowers, vegetation,
rocks, mineral formations, or any
animal, bird, or other life may not be
disturbed, injured, or destroyed; and
formations, rocks, and other natural
features, may not be defaced by writing,
carving, or otherwise marring
them. Since the park is a sanctuary
for wildlife, hunting and the use of
firearms are prohibited.</p>
<p><b>Camping.</b>&mdash;Camp only in established
campgrounds. Keep your camp
area clean. BE CAREFUL WITH
FIRE. Picnicking in the galleries of
Zion Tunnel is not permitted. Lunching
and picnicking prohibited, except
in public auto camp.</p>
<p><b>Disorderly Conduct.</b>&mdash;Proper
conduct is required of all visitors for
the benefit of others who are entitled
to get the fullest enjoyment from the
park.</p>
<p><b>Pets.</b>&mdash;If you are carrying a dog,
cat, or other pet, you may take it
into and through the park provided
it is at all times kept on leash or
otherwise under physical restrictive
control. Pets are not permitted in
public buildings or on trails.</p>
<p><b>Trails.</b>&mdash;Do not attempt to make
short cuts; to do so you may endanger
yourself as well as others using trails.
Before attempting more difficult
trails seek advice from a park ranger.</p>
<p><b>Mountain Climbing.</b>&mdash;Mountain
climbing away from established trails
may not be attempted without permission
of the superintendent.</p>
<p><b>Automobile Regulations.</b>&mdash;(a)
<i>Permit.</i>&mdash;A charge of $1 for each automobile
is made at Bryce Canyon and
Zion National Parks. One permit is
good for both parks, and may be used
during the remainder of the year in
which issued. Trailer fee, $1 extra.</p>
<p>(b) <i>Careful driving.</i>&mdash;The roads in
the park are built purely for scenic
purposes, not as high-speed thoroughfares.
Observe speed limits and
the usual rules of the road; keep to
right; do not park on curves; pass
cars going in the same direction only
when the road ahead is clear and the
vision unobstructed. Maximum speed
limit, 35 miles per hour.</p>
<p>(c) <i>Lights.</i>&mdash;Because of mile-long
highway tunnel, your car must have
its lights in proper condition before
you will be permitted to enter Zion
National Park.</p>
<p><b>Park Rangers.</b>&mdash;The park rangers
are employed to help and advise visitors
as well as to enforce regulations.
When in doubt, ask a ranger.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
